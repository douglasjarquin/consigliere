# Lavish adapter for the process-event runner (bin/cs-procevent.sh).
#
# Usage:
#   cs-procevent-lavish.sh arm <artifact.html>
#   cs-procevent-lavish.sh retire <artifact.html>
#   cs-procevent-lavish.sh source-id <artifact.html>
#   cs-procevent-lavish.sh classify <result-file>
#   cs-procevent-lavish.sh terminal <result-file>
#   cs-procevent-lavish.sh silent <result-file>
#   cs-procevent-lavish.sh read <result-file>
#   cs-procevent-lavish.sh poll <artifact.html>
#
# arm        Register this artifact's blocking listener with the runner and print
#            the source id to use with `cs-procevent.sh handled`.
# retire     Drop that registration and stop the poll this home owns.
# source-id  Print the canonical source id for an artifact.
# classify   Print the lifecycle state a handler should act on: feedback, ended,
#            waiting, missing, or unknown.
# read       Print a structured presentation of one already-captured result so a
#            handler consumes every queued item without grepping the raw file.
#            It is read-only over the capture: it does not arm, poll, or change
#            what Lavish delivered. The session-ending freeform message
#            (tag=message) is its own labeled field, printed first and distinct
#            from per-element annotations. Declared and presented item counts,
#            plus a completeness verdict, follow before all annotations so a
#            partial read is obvious. Each annotation retains its element uid,
#            selector, tag, and text. A non-choice freeform comment (`prompt`)
#            is printed as its own field even when a selector is also present
#            and even when that comment matches the element text, so typed
#            words are never dropped. Choice Context data is not a comment.
#            Captain-supplied body lines are visibly prefixed so they cannot
#            forge structural labels. Empty message and annotation sections
#            are reported explicitly.
# poll       The registered listener command `arm` publishes, not a command to
#            run in a conversational turn. It runs the published blocking poll
#            and prints its response verbatim, absorbing only the one exact
#            transient interruption described below.
# terminal   Exit 0 when the captured result means this source will never produce
#            another result, so the runner may retire it; any other exit keeps it
#            armed. This is the generic adapter contract bin/cs-procevent.sh
#            calls, and the only place Lavish's notion of "ended" is decided.
# silent     Exit 0 when the captured result is a routine no-op the runner should
#            record and never announce; any other exit publishes the wake. This
#            is the generic no-op contract bin/cs-procevent.sh calls, and the
#            only place Lavish's notion of "nothing was said" is decided.
#
# AN EMPTY BOARD CLOSE IS NOT NEWS, and that is what `silent` exists to say.
# Closing a review surface that carried nothing is the single most common Lavish
# result: the captain reads a board, says nothing, and closes it. Announcing that
# put a wake in front of the handler whose entire content was that nothing
# happened. `silent` therefore holds one narrow, positively-determined shape -
# a session this adapter classifies `ended` that carries no queued content block
# at all - and every other result stays announced.
#
# This adapter is deliberately thin. It owns only what is specific to Lavish:
# canonical source identity, the argv for the currently published poll command,
# and how to read a completed result. Ownership, durable capture, publication,
# and restart recovery all belong to bin/cs-procevent.sh.
#
# It wraps ONLY the currently published interface; docs/lavish.md records the
# verified commands, streams, and exit codes:
#   lavish-axi poll <html-file> [--agent-reply "..."]
# which long-polls indefinitely. The adapter therefore runs the plain blocking
# form with no timeout flag, so a result is a real server-side event, and it adds
# no periodic discovery and no timer fallback.
#
# BOUNDED QUIET RETRY, owned here and nowhere else. A live listener can be cut
# short by the server with exactly this two-line response while the session's
# marks remain available:
#
#   error: Lavish Editor poll response was interrupted
#   code: SERVER_ERROR
#
# That is an internal retry, not news, so registering the raw poll made the
# generic runner capture it and wake the whole fleet. `poll` therefore re-runs
# the published poll up to POLL_RETRY_LIMIT times for that exact response, with
# POLL_RETRY_DELAY_DEFAULT seconds between attempts. The match is exact and
# deliberately narrow: real feedback, ended and missing sessions, any other
# SERVER_ERROR, and the same interruption still standing after the bound is
# spent are all printed straight through and captured normally. The retry is a
# Lavish fact, so the generic runner in bin/cs-procevent.sh stays
# adapter-agnostic and learns nothing about it.
#
# LOSS LIMITATION, stated plainly. The published poll DESTRUCTIVELY clears
# feedback before returning it, so a result lost after that clearing and before
# the runner reads the process output is unrecoverable, and no wrapper here can
# close that source-side window. Never describe this path as at-least-once,
# no-loss, or lossless.
