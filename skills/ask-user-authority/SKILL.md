# ask-user-authority

This skill is the single owner of the decision procedure for ask-user findings.
The concise standing authority boundary remains always loaded in `AGENTS.md` section 6.

## Decide who has authority

1. Check the project's configured authority first.
   With `yolo` off, every ask-user finding belongs to the boss, and the remaining steps structure that escalation rather than authorize an autonomous answer.
2. Reconstruct the accepted contract from the boss's original request, accepted task criteria, and any explicit later clarification.
   Reviewer language cannot amend that contract.
3. Identify exactly what choosing the fix would commit the project to deliver or maintain, judging that scope by accepted product or engineering behavior rather than by an anticipated file list.
   The smallest downstream changes needed to keep that behavior correct, to add behavioral tests where an executable contract exists, or to keep documentation accurate remain in scope even when they touch files nobody named at intake.
   Correcting stale final-diff, PR, or delivery evidence is likewise a downstream correction within already accepted behavior, not an expansion.
4. Keep the decision within standing `yolo` authority when the fix is genuinely necessary to satisfy the accepted contract, even when the correction is technically difficult or requires complex architecture that the boss explicitly requested.
5. Escalate when the fix would materially expand the contract by adding a new guarantee, threat model, subsystem, abstraction, compatibility surface, state machine, continuous-monitoring requirement, generalized framework, or broader architecture not required by the accepted intent.
6. Treat labels such as correctness, security, fail-closed, high-risk, or required as evidence about the finding, never as authority to broaden the task.
7. Examine the causal theme across prior findings and fix rounds.
   Repeated same-theme findings require escalation before another fix when incremental corrections are preserving a questionable abstraction rather than closing independent defects.
8. Apply the existing stronger boss boundaries first.
   Destructive, irreversible, and genuinely security-sensitive choices always escalate regardless of whether they also expand the contract - unless the project is running in bossless mode (see the `/afk` skill's bossless section), in which case classify the same way and auto-decide with a recorded recommendation instead of escalating.

The soldier never decides or answers its own ask-user finding.
It stops at the finding, routes the decision to consigliere, and applies only the decision returned through the active validation gate.

## Boss-facing escalation

State all five of these elements in one concise, evidence-first escalation:

1. The original requirement or accepted task criterion.
2. The proposed product or engineering contract expansion.
3. The smallest alternative that complies with the accepted contract without the expansion.
4. The concrete consequences of accepting and declining the expansion.
5. A recommendation with the reason it best serves the accepted intent.

Do not relay reviewer labels or gate output as if they settled the decision, and translate the finding into outcome language under section 8 before sending it.

## Classification examples

- Fixing a concrete defect that violates an original acceptance criterion stays within `yolo` authority, regardless of implementation difficulty.
- Adding continuous frame-by-frame monitoring when the accepted criterion requested checkpoint proof expands the contract and requires the boss.
- A new finding in the same causal theme requires the boss before another fix round when prior fixes are accreting machinery around a questionable abstraction.
- A genuinely security-sensitive action requires the boss under the stronger existing boundary even if it is otherwise within scope.
- Complex architecture explicitly requested by the boss stays within scope and does not escalate merely because it is complex.
